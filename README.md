# Prerequisites: python 3 with requests module and a custom NewsAPI API key.
# This file uses the NewsAPIs API to print articles based on a topic entered by the user.
# The user can also enter other details such as the start and end dates at which the articles were published and the sources for articles.
# In order to use the program you must have your own API key, This can be done by opening the URL https://newsapi.org/ and signing up to get
# your own API key, in the above file, the API key was accessed from my PCs environment variables due to security purposes.
# Any suggestions are welcomed.
